While everyone is entitled to their own perspective, I respectfully disagree that Python is the worst programming language.

As for speed, Python's performance can be optimized for certain use cases through techniques like code optimization and utilization of libraries like NumPy. However, I acknowledge that Python may not be the best choice for all types of applications that require maximum performance.
