        "    *   Initiates the process and prints a message indicating brochure generation has started.\n",
        "    *   Internally calls `get_brochure_user_prompt(company_name, url)` to prepare the prompt for the brochure writer model.\n",
        "    *   Sends this prompt to the `WRITER_MODEL` via `client.chat.completions.create` and streams the response to the display.\n",

        "    *   Prints a message about fetching website content.\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **`fetch_page_and_all_relevant_links(url)`**:\n",
        "    *   First, it fetches the content of the main URL by calling `fetch_website_contents(url)`.\n",
        "    *   Then, it identifies relevant links on the website by calling `select_relevant_links(url)`.\n",
        "    *   For each relevant link found, it prints which link type is being read and then calls `fetch_website_contents(link[\"url\"])` again to get the content of that specific linked page.\n",
        "    *   Aggregates all fetched content into a single string.\n",
        "\n",

        "    *   Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs and returns a unique list of all found links.\n",
